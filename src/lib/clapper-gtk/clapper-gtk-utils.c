/**
 * clapper_gtk_get_player_from_ancestor:
 * @widget: a #GtkWidget
 *
 * Get [class@Clapper.Player] used by [class@ClapperGtk.Av] ancestor of @widget.
 *
 * This utility is a convenience wrapper for calling [method@Gtk.Widget.get_ancestor]
 * of type `CLAPPER_GTK_TYPE_AV` and [method@ClapperGtk.Av.get_player] with
 * additional %NULL checking and type casting.
 *
 * This is meant to be used mainly for custom widget development as an easy access to the
 * underlying parent [class@Clapper.Player] object. If you want to get the player from
 * [class@ClapperGtk.Av] widget itself, use [method@ClapperGtk.Av.get_player] instead.
 *
 * Rememeber that this function will return %NULL when widget does not have
 * a [class@ClapperGtk.Av] ancestor in widget hierarchy (widget is not yet placed).
 *
 * Returns: (transfer none) (nullable): a #ClapperPlayer from ancestor of a @widget.
