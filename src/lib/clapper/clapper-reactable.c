/**
 * clapper_reactable_get_player:
 * @reactable: a #ClapperReactable
 *
 * Get the [class@Clapper.Player] that this reactable is reacting to.
 *
 * This is meant to be used in implementations where reaction goes the
 * other way around (from enhancer plugin to the player). For example
 * some external event needs to influence parent player object like
 * changing its state, seeking, etc.
 *
 * Note that enhancers are working in a non-main application thread, thus
 * if you need to do operations on a [class@Clapper.Queue] such as adding/removing
 * items, you need to switch thread first. Otherwise this will not be thread safe
 * for applications that use single threaded toolkits such as #GTK. You can do this
 * manually or use provided reactable convenience functions.
 *
 * Due to the threaded nature, you should also avoid comparisons to the current
 * properties values in the player or its queue. While these are thread safe, there
 * is no guarantee that values/objects between threads are still the same in both
 * (or still exist). For example, instead of using [property@Clapper.Queue:current_item],
 * monitor it with implemented [vfunc@Clapper.Reactable.played_item_changed] instead,
 * as these functions are all serialized into your implementation thread.
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full) (nullable): A reference to the parent #ClapperPlayer.
